# jqFormValidator

A jQuery plugin, made for validating input in web browser without the need to have form element. 
i made it as i didnt find any form validator packages that can help validate inputs without form element encapsulating them. 


# Why i create the plugin?
- didnt found a way to validate only some input in a form element. 
- dont want to trigger form-submit just to get the form validating function. 
- ive been wanting to create at least one plugin. so this is my first one, hahaha:P

# How to use?
- try clone the repo & open the index file using web browser.

# warning (i guess?)
- there are only 4 validations available (required, min, regex & filePdf) as these are the only things i need to use in my current project.
- i tried to make it as general as i can, but i'm well aware that it still has a lot more to do to make it work as a good plugin.
- i only update the code if my project requires me to make it better. 
- so the plugin will be beta until God knows when, hahaha.
- im so honored if u guys like it & want to make any changes to the code. oh, & do me a favor of tagging me or whats not, so that i can learn from u guys :')
- looking forward to your guidance (me bowing sincerely..) 

# Shout out
- thanks to the jquery team for writing the nice document for creating a plugin.
